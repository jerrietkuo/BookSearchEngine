# Book Search Engine - MERN Stack

## Description

This is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. Users can create an account, log in, and save books to their personal reading list. This project utilizes a GraphQL API powered by Apollo Server, replacing the traditional RESTful API architecture. The application is built with a React front end, MongoDB database, Node.js/Express.js server, and handles user authentication.

## Features

- Search for books using the Google Books API.
- User authentication (Signup, Login, Logout).
- Save books to a personal reading list.
- Remove books from the saved list.
- Fully functional GraphQL API with queries and mutations for book management.
- Responsive and polished user interface.
